### Hola a todos ðŸ‘‹

I am Raimundo Sanchez, complex systems scientist and ultra-trail runner. I teach Data Science Workshops at Adolfo IbÃ¡Ã±ez University (Santiago de Chile) where I also do my research on the uses of digital devices for analyzing physical activity. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on analyzing trail running activities, this task divides in gathering the data, modeling race parameters and performance prediction. 
- ðŸŒ± Also Iâ€™m currently learning how to design attractive visualizations from data, also know as generative Art
- ðŸ‘¯ I mostly code in R using RStudio. Have also some experience in C#, Matlab, Python, Stata, Visual Basic and Javascript, but R is my favorite tool. 

My project for analyzing activity streams from GPS devices: [ESStream](https://github.com/raimun2/ESStream)

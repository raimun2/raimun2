### Hola a todos ðŸ‘‹

I am Raimundo SÃ¡nchez, a complex systems engineer and mountain athlete. I teach data engineering at Adolfo IbÃ¡Ã±ez University (Santiago de Chile) where I also do my research on the use of digital devices to study physical activity.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on the analysis of trail running activities, this task is divided into data collection, modeling of running parameters and performance prediction.
- ðŸŒ± I'm also working on geospatial data science
- ðŸ‘¯ I mainly program in R using RStudio. I also have some experience in C#, Matlab, Python, Stata, Visual Basic, and Javascript, but R is my favorite tool.

My project to analyze data streams from GPS devices: [GPStream](https://github.com/raimun2/GPStream)

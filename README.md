### Hola a todos ðŸ‘‹

I am Raimundo Sanchez, complex systems scientist and ultra-trail runner.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on analyzing trail running activities, this task divides in following sub-problems: gathering the data, modeling race parameters and performance prediction. 
- ðŸŒ± Also Iâ€™m currently learning how to design attractive visualizations from data, also know as generative Art
- ðŸ‘¯ I mostly code in R #Rstats

My project for analyzing activity streams from GPS devices: [ESStream](https://github.com/raimun2/ESStream)
